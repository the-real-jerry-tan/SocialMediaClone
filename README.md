# Kotlin Social Media App Clone

This project is a clone of a social media application built using **Kotlin Multiplatform**, supporting both Android and iOS platforms. It demonstrates the power of shared Kotlin code for mobile development and includes basic social media functionalities like user authentication, post creation, likes, and comments.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Login and registration system.
- **Post Creation**: Users can create and share posts.
- **Likes and Comments**: Users can interact with posts by liking and commenting.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Built using Kotlin Multiplatform, allowing shared code between Android and iOS.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Android Studio** with Kotlin plugin installed.
- **Android SDK** installed and configured.
- **Xcode** (for iOS development) installed and configured.
- **CocoaPods** (optional for iOS, if the project requires it).

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/KotlinSocialMediaAppClone.git
   cd KotlinSocialMediaAppClone
   ```

2. **Sync Gradle** (for Android):
   - Open the project in IntelliJ or Android Studio.
   - Sync Gradle to download the necessary dependencies.

3. **Build and Run on Android**:
   - Use the Android SDK to run the Android app.
   - Navigate to the `androidApp` module and click **Run**.

4. **Build and Run on iOS**:
   - Open the `iosApp` directory in Xcode.
   - Run the app on an iOS simulator or device.

## Logical Next Steps for Enhancement

1. **Profile Pages**: Implement user profiles where users can view and edit their own information and see other users' posts.
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Add support for real-time updates using websockets or Firebase.
3. **Notifications**: Implement push notifications for new likes, comments, and followers.
4. **Post Sharing**: Allow users to share posts with others or on external platforms.
5. **Improved UI**: Enhance the user interface for better usability and design consistency across platforms.
6. **Backend Integration**: Implement a real backend service for handling user data, post storage, and interactions.

## Testing

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Set up unit tests for the shared Kotlin codebase to ensure the core functionalities like authentication, post creation, and interaction logic work properly on both platforms.

2. **UI Testing**:
   - Implement UI tests for both Android and iOS to validate that the interface works as expected on different screen sizes and resolutions.
